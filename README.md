 🚀 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered medical diagnosis system** that predicts multiple diseases using machine learning models. The diseases covered include:

- 🫀 Heart Disease
- 🧠 Parkinson's Disease
- 🫁 Lung Cancer
- 🦋 Thyroid Disorders**
- 💉 Diabetes

The system is built using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and is deployed using Streamlit.

 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
The following models were trained and saved for predictions:
- **Heart Disease: Logistic Regression
- **Parkinson's: SVM
- **Lung Cancer: Logistic Regression
- **Thyroid: SVM

Each model was trained using feature engineering techniques and saved in `.sav` format for deployment.
